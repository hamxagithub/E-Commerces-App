## <a name="_toc184327775"></a>**19.1 Creational Patterns (Singleton Pattern):**

### `		`**<a name="_toc184327776"></a>19.1.1. Admin Class:** 
**Name:                   Singleton**

**Problem:** Ensuring consistent system management requires a single admin instance.

**Solution:** The Admin class uses a private constructor and a static variable to enforce a single instance, ensuring centralized control and avoiding conflicts.

**Consequences:** Centralizes control, ensuring consistency. Limits flexibility for multiple admins in the future.

- **Code:**
- <a name="_toc184327777"></a>public class AISystem {
- `    `private static AISystem instance;

- `    `// Private constructor to prevent object creation
- `    `private AISystem() {}

- `    `public static AISystem getInstance() {
- `        `if (instance == null) {
- `            `instance = new AISystem();
- `        `}
- `        `return instance;
- `    `}

- `    `// AI-related methods
- `    `public void analyzeBehavior() {
- `        `// Analyze user behavior

### **19.1.2. AI System Class**
**Name:                   Singleton**

**Problem:** Maintaining efficient and consistent AI processing requires a single AI instance.

**Solution:**  The AI System employs a private constructor and a static reference to ensure a single instance, enabling centralized processing and resource efficiency.

**Consequences:** Reduces redundancy and ensures consistency. Limits concurrent handling of diverse payment methods.

- **Code:**
- public class Payment {
- `    `private static Payment instance;

- `    `// Private constructor to prevent object creation
- `    `private Payment() {}

- `    `public static Payment getInstance() {
- `        `if (instance == null) {
- `            `instance = new Payment();
- `        `}
- `        `return instance;
- `    `}

- `    `// Payment-related methods
- `    `public void processPayment() {
- `        `// Process the payment
- `    `}
- }

## <a name="_toc184327779"></a>**19.2 Structural Patterns (Adapter Pattern):**

### <a name="_toc184327780"></a>**19.2.1. Payment Gateway Class**
**Name:                   Adapter**

**Problem:** Different payment gateways have incompatible interfaces**.**

**Solution:** Adapters like SadaAdapter and PayPalAdapter bridge the gap by adapting specific methods to a common PaymentGateway interface**.**

**Consequences:** Simplifies integration of diverse gateways. Adds complexity through multiple adapter classes.

- <a name="_toc184327781"></a>**Code:**
- // External Payment Gateway 1
- class SadaPaymentGateway {
- `    `public void sadaPayment(String customer, double amount) {
- `        `System.out.println("Sada payment of $" + amount + " for " + customer);
- `    `}
- }

- // External Payment Gateway 2
- class PayPalPaymentGateway {
- `    `public void paypalTransaction(String customerEmail, double amount) {
- `        `System.out.println("PayPal: Payment of $" + amount + " processed for " + customerEmail);
- `    `}
- }

- // Target Interface
- interface PaymentGateway {
- `    `void processPayment(String customer, double amount);
- }

- // Adapter for Stripe
- class SadaAdapter implements PaymentGateway {
- `    `private SadaPaymentGateway stripeGateway;

- `    `public SadaAdapter() {
- `        `this.stripeGateway = new SadaPaymentGateway();
- `    `}

- `    `@Override
- `    `public void processPayment(String customer, double amount) {
- `        `stripeGateway.sadaPayment(customer, amount); // Adapting to Stripe's method
- `    `}
- }

- // Adapter for PayPal
- class PayPalAdapter implements PaymentGateway {
- `    `private PayPalPaymentGateway payPalGateway;

- `    `public PayPalAdapter() {
- `        `this.payPalGateway = new PayPalPaymentGateway();
- `    `}

- `    `@Override
- `    `public void processPayment(String customer, double amount) {
- `        `payPalGateway.paypalTransaction(customer, amount); // Adapting to PayPal's method
- `    `}
- }

- // Client Code
- public class AdapterPatternExample {
- `    `public static void main(String[] args) {
- `        `// Using Stripe
- `        `PaymentGateway sadaPayment = new SadaAdapter();
- `        `sadaPayment.processPayment("Alice", 150.00);

- `        `// Using PayPal
- `        `PaymentGateway paypalPayment = new PayPalAdapter();
- `        `paypalPayment.processPayment("bob@example.com", 200.50);
- `    `}
- }

## **19.3 Behavioral Patterns (Observer Pattern):**

### <a name="_toc184327782"></a>**19.3.1.  Inventory Class:** 
**Name:                   Observer**

**Problem:** Components like the UI and notifications need updates when stock changes.

**Solution:** The Inventory class notifies registered observers, ensuring all components are synchronized with stock updates.**.**

**Consequences:** Enhances maintainability through decoupling. Performance can degrade with frequent updates and many observers.

- **Code:**
- import java.util.ArrayList;
- import java.util.List;

- // Subject (Observable)
- class Inventory {
- `    `private List<Observer> observers = new ArrayList<>();
- `    `private int stock;

- `    `public void addObserver(Observer observer) {
- `        `observers.add(observer);
- `    `}

- `    `public void removeObserver(Observer observer) {
- `        `observers.remove(observer);
- `    `}

- `    `public void setStock(int stock) {
- `        `this.stock = stock;
- `        `notifyObservers();
- `    `}

- `    `public int getStock() {
- `        `return stock;
- `    `}

- `    `private void notifyObservers() {
- `        `for (Observer observer : observers) {
- `            `observer.update(stock);
- `        `}
- `    `}
- }

- // Observer Interface
- interface Observer {
- `    `void update(int stock);
- }

- // Concrete Observers
- class UI implements Observer {
- `    `@Override
- `    `public void update(int stock) {
- `        `System.out.println("UI updated: Stock is now " + stock);
- `    `}
- }

- class Notifications implements Observer {
- `    `@Override
- `    `public void update(int stock) {
- `        `System.out.println("Notification sent: Stock updated to " + stock);
- `    `}
- }

- // Main Class
- public class ObserverPatternExample {
- `    `public static void main(String[] args) {
- `        `Inventory inventory = new Inventory();

- `        `// Create Observers
- `        `UI ui = new UI();
- `        `Notifications notifications = new Notifications();

- `        `// Register Observers
- `        `inventory.addObserver(ui);
- `        `inventory.addObserver(notifications);

- `        `// Simulate Stock Updates
- `        `inventory.setStock(50); // Notify all observers
- `        `inventory.setStock(30);
- `    `}
- }

# <a name="_toc184327783"></a>**20. GRASP (Design Patterns):**
## <a name="_toc184327784"></a>**20.1 Creator:**
### <a name="_toc184327785"></a>**20.1.1.  Vendor and Product**
**Name:                   Creator**

**Problem:** Who should be responsible for creating Product instances for a Vendor?

**Solution:** The Vendor class should create Product instances as it aggregates and closely manages them. This ensures better cohesion and control over product creation. By centralizing the product creation within the Vendor class, you maintain a clean responsibility structure.
###
### <a name="_toc184327786"></a>**20.1.2.  Inventory and Product**
**Name:                   Creator**

**Problem:** Who should be responsible for creating Product instances for inventory management?

**Solution:** The Inventory class should create and manage Product instances, as it controls the stock and product information. This aligns with the Inventory's role in managing product availability. By centralizing this responsibility, the system avoids scattered creation logic and maintains clear ownership.












##
## <a name="_toc184327787"></a>**20.2 Information Expert:**

**Name:                   Information Expert**

**Problem:** The Inventory class should manage stock data, but Product or Vendor handling stock operations violates the Information Expert principle.

**Solution:** Assign stock-related responsibilities to the Inventory class to maintain efficient task management. The Inventory should store stock data and provide stock-related methods like checkStock() and updateStock(). This ensures proper separation of concerns and prevents misuse of product and vendor classes.
## <a name="_toc184327788"></a>**20.3 Controller:**

**Name:                   Controller**

**Problem:** If your Order Controller doesn’t handle all user events related to orders, it may lead to confusion and inefficiencies.

**Solution:** Ensure the Order Controller handles all relevant user events such as adding items, checking out, and viewing the cart. Delegate complex tasks like pricing calculations and payment processing to specialized services. Implement the MVC pattern to separate concerns and improve system maintainability.


## <a name="_toc184327789"></a>**20.4 Low Coupling:**

**Name:                   Low Coupling**

**Problem:** If the Payment classes are directly connected to external payment services like PayPal or Sadapay, changes in those services could break the system..

**Solution** Use a Payment Gateway Adapter to act as an intermediary between the Payment classes and external payment services. This decouples the system from the specifics of payment services. By using dependency injection, the system can easily switch between payment services without affecting other components.


## <a name="_toc184327790"></a>**20.5 High Cohesion:**

**Name:                   High Cohesion**

**Problem:** The Pricing Engine might be responsible for too many tasks, such as applying discounts or calculating taxes, which violates high cohesion.** 

**Solution** Refactor the Pricing Engine to focus solely on pricing calculations. Move other responsibilities like discounts, taxes, and promotions to separate classes. This keeps the Pricing Engine focused on its core task and makes the system more modular and maintainable.

## <a name="_toc184327791"></a>**20.6 Polymorphism:**

**Name:                   Polymorphism**

**Problem:** If discount types (e.g., percentage, fixed) are implemented as separate, non-polymorphic classes, it can lead to code duplication.

**Solution:** Implement a DiscountRule interface or abstract class, and create subclasses for each discount type (e.g., PercentageDiscount, FixedDiscount). This allows the system to treat all discount types uniformly and extend the system easily by adding new discount types.
## <a name="_toc184327792"></a>**20.7 Pure Fabrication:**

**Name:                   Pure Fabrication** 

**Problem:** The Admin class is responsible for generating reports, violating the Pure Fabrication principle.** 

**Solution:** Introduce a Report Generator class dedicated to generating reports such as sales or inventory. Refactor the Admin class to delegate report generation tasks to this new class. This ensures better separation of concerns and improves system modularity.
##
##
##
## <a name="_toc184327793"></a>**20.8 Indirection:**

**Name:                   Indirection** 

**Problem:** If the system communicates directly with external recommendation engines, it could lead to tight coupling and complicate future changes.

**Solution:** Introduce an API Gateway as an intermediary between the internal system and external engines. The API Gateway will handle communication, decoupling the internal system from the specifics of external services. It also enables easier upgrades, switching between engines, and enhances system security and scalability.
